<br> WARNING: H++ is automatically processing your ligand input. 
This is always a tricky business (e.g. ligands may contain unanticipated characteristics ), 
therefore we strongly recommended that you closely review the following log messages. In case of an error, or if in doubt, prepare the ligand input manually as described in the FAQ. <br>
NO LIGAND_NET_CHARGE is availabe from the INPUT PDB.
